# ESPHome Support of Seeed Studio mmWave Human Detection Sensor Kit 

Recently, I have been involved in making this the mmWave human detection kit officially supported by ESPHome, which means no-code experience for the Home Assistant community. Though this kit is designed for both makers and Home Assistant community at the beginning, we found that there are still barriers for the potential users to leverage its expandability and compatibility, especially those with weak technical backgrounds. We of course hope that this kit could benefit more users, especially those who are quite interested in Home Assistant but new to it.  @Jesse from ESPHome helped me realize this, now the pilot version of ESPHome integration has been finsihed, here is a page I specially made for firmware flash: https://limengdu.github.io/mmwave-kit-external-components/

1.If you already have this mmWave sensor kit and want to test it and give me some useful feedback, I would be reallly appreciate it! 
2.If you have any problems in tinkering with these problems, try this!
