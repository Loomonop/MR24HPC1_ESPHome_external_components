# ESPHome Support of Seeed Studio mmWave Human Detection Sensor Kit 

Recently, I have been involved in [making this the mmWave human detection kit](https://www.seeedstudio.com/mmWave-Human-Detection-Sensor-Kit-p-5773.html) officially supported by ESPHome, which means no-code experience for the Home Assistant community. Though this kit is designed for both makers and Home Assistant community at the beginning, we found that there are still barriers for the potential users to leverage its expandability and compatibility, especially those with weak technical backgrounds. We of course hope that this kit could benefit more users, especially those who are quite interested in Home Assistant but new to it.  @Jesse from ESPHome helped me realize this, now the pilot version of ESPHome integration has been finsihed, here is a page I specially made for firmware flash: https://limengdu.github.io/mmwave-kit-external-components/

If you have purchased the kit but haven't had the opportunity to use it successfully, now is the perfect time to give it a go. Since it's the pilot version, please do report them if you encounter any bugs or problems while using it.
